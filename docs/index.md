## Welcome to Marathon

Marathon is a collection of modules designed to make using Dart on the server-side easier.

## Why Another Serverside Framework

- **Maintained and maintainable:** Every other notable server-side effort in Dart is abandoned or sporadically maintained. Most of these had issues because of their monolithic nature.
- **Built in Dart:** Dart is a nice language. It maintains readability and traditional C-style syntax while bringing modern languge features.
- **Modular:** it's based around [shelf](https://pub.dev/packages/shelf), a minimal web server built and maintained by the Dart team. You can use Marathon's routing, authentication, ORM, and more independently of each other. 
- **Clean and dependency-free:** We've minimized third-party dependencies to avoid getting you in dependency hell.
- **Well documented:** Each module of Marathon has been extensively documented and planned to avoid unexpected behavior.
